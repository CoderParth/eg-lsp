# eg-lsp

A lsp server for my custom language - [EG](https://github.com/CoderParth/EG). <br>

This lsp server was written without <br>
using any external libraries - same <br>
as the way the interpreter was written. 


At this stage, only diagnostics messages <br>
have been implemented. <br> 

Some screenshots of this lsp server in <br> 
use have been added below. <br>
The client text-editor was Neovim in <br>
these examples. 

References used to create a boiler-plate, <br>
and to get the server up and running are <br> 
mentioned below: <br>
